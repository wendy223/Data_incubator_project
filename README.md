# proposed project for Facebook Followers

Facebook Follower Project


Motivations:
It’s very interesting and powerful to analyze the real feedback data from the Facebook follower. It’s probably not obvious to generate some relationship at first glances. But detailed follower analysis is important for each company to help them know their economic performance and predict the future trends. This interesting data is worth further and deeper investigation.


Data Sources and Introduction:
Facebook provide a myriad of data points about companies such as customer traction, foot traffic, and brand awareness among others and explain the analysis you are performing.
	This dataset contains information from more than 1 million cases with 14 columns describing their properties. This dataset contains more than 3163 companies from 2015 to 2018. Facebook followers provide the information about ‘checkins’, ‘were_here_count’, ‘likes’, ‘talking_about_count’ and ‘facebook_id’ etc.


Potential questions to tackle for this Project:
1.	Compare companies with highest volatility of “talking about count” — who they are – and use any information online to see if this metric overlaps with highly publicized events and marketing campaigns.

2.	Facebook check-ins as a metric for foot traffic for restaurant, hospitality and retail businesses. Who are the winners in attracting customers to physical locations.

3.	Facebook followers and which companies are the most successful at growing social media traction

4.	What companies have the top five likes; what’s the types of these companies? Probably we find either high-tech or fast-food-restaurant.

5.	Using moving averaging model to analyze the popularity of a series of companies.

6.	Using domain knowledge to pick out the semi-conductor and oil/chemical/manufacturing companies, it’s interesting to know whether they showed any cyclic effect. 



Impact of the project:

1.	For each company, they can know their popularities among the social media by ‘likes’ or ‘talking_about_count’
2.	For the food or grocery company etc., they can know their economic performance by ‘checkins’ or ‘were_here_count’. 
3.	The data is also large enough to predict the trends.
